        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Plainfield was founded in 1839 by Elias Hadley and Levi Jessup. Many of the early settlers of Plainfield were Quakers, members of the Religious Society of Friends. The Quakers are still referenced today in the logo/mascot of the local schools. Plainfield was known for an incident in 1842 where, in protest of President Martin Van Buren's veto of a bill aiming to repair highways, a coachman drove Van Buren's carriage fast through a disrepaired section of US 40 that went through the town, causing the president to fall into a pile of mud.</p>
