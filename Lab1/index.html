    <h1>Desolation (My Dungeons & Dragons Campaign)</h1>
    <p>Over the past couple years, I've been running an original D&D campaign for my friends. It's setting is original (as opposed to being set in Faerûn, the typical setting for D&D), but it is heavily inspired by the setting of Dune. In this setting, a sudden violent war between every dragon on the planet eroded the atmosphere of the planet away, killing nearly all life. For the past 50 years, all people have lived in Glainne, a city with an artificial atmosphere created by a tech-savvy sorceress. Everything outside of Glainne is a desert hellscape, dubbed the Desolation by locals.</p>
