    <h1>Desolation (My Dungeons & Dragons Campaign)</h1>
    <p>Over the past couple years, I've been running an original D&D campaign for my friends. It's setting is original (as opposed to being set in Faerûn, the typical setting for D&D), but it is heavily inspired by the setting of Dune. In this setting, a sudden violent war between every dragon on the planet eroded the atmosphere of the planet away, killing nearly all life. For the past 50 years, all people have lived in Glainne, a city with an artificial atmosphere created by a tech-savvy sorceress. Everything outside of Glainne is a desert hellscape, dubbed the Desolation by locals.</p>
    <p>The player characters are as follows: Otto Vesuvius is a bank accountant seeking wealth by getting into the good draces of a druglord known only as the Hammer. Petrolio Molitari is a wizard desperate for fame and validation by way of saving the world, whose true need is real connection and a way to escape his important father's shadow. Sage is a wood elf, crushed by the death of the planet's nature and driven by a need to fulfill his mother's dying wish: to one day return home and replant her favorite tree. The Knight is an armor-clad skeleton, brought back to life by the goddess Mishakal to save the planet. Augustus Temperfortune was once a noble before the end of the world, and is now a vagrant whose only connection is with Beshaba, the goddess of misfortune.</p>
    <p>These characters have discovered hints left by followers of Lathander, the god of renewal, on how to reverse the damage done by the now-extinct dragons. They are being pursued and countered by "Lathander's Prophets", a group that is convinced that renewal comes not from saving the world, but by letting all life die so that the gods may start again with a clean slate. On top of this, many in the city suffer from a major class and power struggle.</p>
