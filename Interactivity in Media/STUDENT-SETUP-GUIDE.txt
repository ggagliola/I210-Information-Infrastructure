📥 STUDENT SETUP GUIDE
Interactive JavaScript Demo
==========================================

Follow these steps to get ready for the live coding demo!

==========================================
STEP 1: DOWNLOAD THE FILES
==========================================

1. Go to the provided link (your instructor will share this)

2. Click the GREEN "Code" button

3. Click "Download ZIP"

4. Save the file to your Desktop or Downloads folder


==========================================
STEP 2: EXTRACT THE ZIP FILE
==========================================

Windows:
  • Right-click on the downloaded ZIP file
  • Select "Extract All..."
  • Click "Extract"
  • A new folder will appear

Mac:
  • Double-click the ZIP file
  • It will automatically extract


==========================================
STEP 3: OPEN IN VS CODE
==========================================

1. Open Visual Studio Code

2. Click "File" → "Open Folder"

3. Navigate to the extracted folder (probably called "live-demo")

4. Click "Select Folder" or "Open"

You should now see 3 files in the sidebar:
  ✓ index.html
  ✓ styles.css
  ✓ script.js


==========================================
STEP 4: OPEN THE WEBSITE
==========================================

1. In VS Code, RIGHT-CLICK on "index.html"

2. Select "Reveal in File Explorer" (Windows) or "Reveal in Finder" (Mac)

3. In the file explorer window, RIGHT-CLICK on "index.html"

4. Select "Open with" → Your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

You should now see a beautiful movie stage in your browser!


==========================================
STEP 5: ARRANGE YOUR SCREEN
==========================================

For the best experience:

Split your screen:
  • Left side: VS Code (showing script.js)
  • Right side: Web browser (showing the stage)

This way you can see the code AND the result at the same time!


==========================================
DURING THE DEMO
==========================================

• WATCH your instructor type code in script.js
• You DON'T need to type along (just watch!)
• REFRESH your browser when instructor says to see changes
• Ask questions if confused!


==========================================
WHAT YOU'LL SEE
==========================================

For Level 1
Before JavaScript:
  • Box with red color

After JavaScript:
  • Box with blue color


For Level 2
Before JavaScript:
  • Beautiful stage with red curtains
  • Two spotlights (not lit)
  • A director character standing on stage
  •  button that don't do anything

After JavaScript:
  • Click "Turn ON Lights" → Spotlights shine!


==========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
==========================================

PROBLEM: I don't see three files in VS Code
SOLUTION: Make sure you opened the FOLDER, not just one file

PROBLEM: The website looks broken or weird
SOLUTION: Make sure all 3 files are in the same folder

PROBLEM: The buttons don't work
SOLUTION: That's normal! They won't work until we add JavaScript

PROBLEM: I can't find the folder I extracted
SOLUTION: Check your Desktop and Downloads folder


==========================================
AFTER THE DEMO
==========================================

You'll have the complete code to take home!

Try these at home:
  • Click the buttons and watch it work
  • Look at the code in script.js
  • Experiment and have fun!


==========================================
