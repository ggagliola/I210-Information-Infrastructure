            <h3>Quakers</h3>
            <p>The town was named after the "plain" people known as Quakers. Quakers were people who belong to the Religious Society of Friends, a coalition of multiple Protestant and Evangelical Christian groups. Many of these "Quakers" settled into Plainfield and set up several meetinghouses there. Their influence on early Plainfield is honored today through the mascot of Plainfield High School.</p>

            <h3>Martin Van Buren</h3>
            <p>U.S. Route 40 runs straight through the town of Plainfield, and became to focal point of a small political story. In 1842, then-President Martin Van Buren vetoed a bill to improve the highway. As he was travelling America to gather support for his 1844 re-election campaign, a group of Plainfield residents sent his coach down a disrepaired section of the highway to demonstrate the result of his veto. He was spilled out of his coach and into a thick puddle of mud on the road. A plaque still marks the spot where he fell, and a nearby elementary school is named Van Buren after this incident.</p>
